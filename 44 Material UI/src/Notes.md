Material UI rebranded itself to MUI

MUI components are written as React components, pure React, not plain HTML/CSS.

They use React concepts like:
    props
    state
    hooks
    JSX

Material UI (MUI) is developed by an independent open-source team

Maintained by MUI company / community

MUI is based on Google’s Material Design guidelines.

MUI System (styling engine) → Foundation (styling & layout)
↑
Material UI & Joy UI → Component libraries built on top
