# useCallback

--> lifecycle, react memo, useMemo

✅ Every re-render = functions are recreated

Even if logic is same, function reference changes

# useCallback is a React hook that memoizes a function, so the same function reference is reused between renders unless dependencies change.

# thank you much


# kha kha use nahi karna hai isse:-

- function as a props pass nahi kar rhe ho tab
- small application
- light weight component

# useMemo value memoize karta hai, and useCallback function memoize kar rha hota hai...!!!!
